# COVID-19-Vaccine-Workbook
As a project in Tableau I created this workbook analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 Vaccination data from across the globe. This included the use of filters on both dates and locations. The workbook itself is included as well as a preview image of the project. The data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oMrHuOkbXAoXibN6UzHUkNrwqvjQVFOU8CuqFMVZiUo/edit#gid=2010174370).
